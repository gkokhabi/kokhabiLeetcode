/*
Leetcode number: 141

Given head, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.

Return true if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return false.

class Solution {
public:
    bool hasCycle(ListNode *head) {
	
		// if head is NULL then return false;
        if(head == NULL)
            return false;
        
		// making two pointers fast and slow and assignning them to head
        ListNode *fast = head;
        ListNode *slow = head;
        
		// till fast and fast-> next not reaches NULL
		// we will increment fast by 2 step and slow by 1 step
        while(fast != NULL && fast ->next != NULL)
        {
            fast = fast->next->next;
            slow = slow->next;
            
			
			// At the point if fast and slow are at same address
			// this means linked list has a cycle in it.
            if(fast == slow)
                return true;
        }
        
		// if traversal reaches to NULL this means no cycle.
        return false;
